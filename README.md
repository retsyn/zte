# ZTE: Time Saving Tools for ZBrush Artists.
### How to use:

Open the folder `C:\Program Files\Maxon ZBrush 2022\ZStartup\Macros\Misc` on your PC (Note that if you have an older installation, it may be `C:\Program Files\Pixelogic ZBrush 2022\ZStartup\Macros\Misc`) and copy zte.txt into that folder.

Next time you open ZBrush, new functions will appear in the **_bottom of the Tools window_**.
